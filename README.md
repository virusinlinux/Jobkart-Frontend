#### For Job Seeker

1. Register
2. Update Profile
3. Apply on jobs - just by clicking - as simple as that.
4. The applicant gets an SMS on his/her phone number after applying to a job.
   ![SMS TO APPLICANT]
#### For Job Poster

1. Post Jobs
2. Get applications on your posted jobs and shortlist.
3. **Ease the flow** for both parties
   - Job Seekers Profiles will be available all throughout, Recruiters can directly see their profiles and give them a message/call
4. Job Poster gets an email when someone applies on a job posted by him/her.
   ![MAIL TO RECRUITER]

#### Problems in Existing Solutions

- Little Less user friendly for maybe not so literate people
- Complicated Process - Job Portal for Unorganized Sector dont have a resume.
- All in English
- Lack of Support on chat/call

### Pending Tasks

- Unit Tests - Due to shortage of time, I couldn't write many unit-test.
- Login Sessions and Dashboard of Applications

### Additional Features to be added after Hackathon:

- Multi-lingual
- Filters according to location, salary etc.
- Stars/Reviews for job seekers
- Register by calling also (for job seekers) - simply call on a support number and automated clicks on phone
